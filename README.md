# Graphic adventures

This is a collection of graphical or geometrical algorithm and visualisation.
All the renderin is done with Python Arcade.

- `polygon.py` : procedures to generate random polygons with *n* vertices.
- `triangulation.py` : triangulate a given polygon. It needs for the vertices to be ordered (it will reorder them in a counter-clockwise order).
